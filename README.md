# Crafting Interpreters using Rust

Just my perusal of Bob Nystrom's [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/) book. Since I've been on a Rust kick, I'm trying to use that instead of Java (which I don't particularly like). This is the first part of the book where we build a tree-walk interpreter. Some of the concepts in Java aren't going to translate cleanly so it's going to get a little messy at times.

I'll be going in order and marking the chapters off as I make my way through them. If I somehow find the time I might blog about any thing weird or that trips me up along the way.
