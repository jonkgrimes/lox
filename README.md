# Crafting Interpreters using Rust

Just my perusal of Bob Nystrom's [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/) book. Since I've been on a Rust kick, I'm trying to use that instead of Java (which I don't particularly like).

I'll be going in order and marking the chapters off as I make my way through them. If I somehow find the time I might blog about any thing weird or that trips me up along the way.

### Current Chapter

- [ ] Chapter 7 - Evaluating Expressions
